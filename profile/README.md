# 10 million green workers in 10 years

At [greenworkx](https://greenworkx.org), our mission is to tackle the green skills emergency by reaching 10 million green workers in 10 years.

## There is a green skills emergency

**30 million** more green workers are needed globally **by 2030** for us to reach net-zero and prevent catastrophic climate breakdown.

Without these workers, we won't be able to build the critical green infrastucture that we need for renewable power, energy efficiency and electric vehicles.

## A brighter future for people and the planet

We need to greenify our economy - and the change is already happening.

Green jobs are in-demand, creating well-paid, secure and meaningful employment opportunities for millions in the UK alone.

What if we could turn those good, green jobs into accessible opportunities for people?

## Making good, green jobs accessible to millions

Did you know that you can earn Â£28k+ as a starting salary in a green job, without a degree?

Most people don't. We want to change that.

We're building a talent portal, network and career accelerator where you can discover new green jobs, learn practical green skills and get matched to green opportunities.
